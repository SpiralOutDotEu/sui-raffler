## **Decentralized Protocol Terms**

_Last Updated: 2025-01-14_  
_The following terms are provided as an informational template only and should not be considered legal advice._

### **TL;DR (Non-Legal Summary)**

This is a decentralized, non-custodial, experimental protocol on the Sui blockchain. Use it at your own risk. The protocol’s contributors do not run or control prize distributions, do not custody funds, and do not guarantee availability, randomness, legality, or any outcomes. You must ensure you are legally allowed to use this protocol in your region and that your content is lawful. Transactions are irreversible. A ~5% protocol fee applies and is adjustable by the smart contract. NSFW or illegal content is prohibited. A pause function exists for emergency mitigation, but cannot reverse past transactions. The blockchain is final.

- Purchase or allocate participation entries
    
- Have rewards distributed based on randomized selection  
    6.2. All actions initiated through the front-end or smart contracts are **executed directly by the blockchain**, not by SUI Raffler contributors.  
    6.3. Once submitted to the blockchain, transactions are irreversible.
    

## 7. Protocol Fees

7.1. A protocol fee of approximately **5%** may be collected per event as specified by the smart contract.  
7.2. This fee may be adjustable through contract governance or upgrade mechanisms built into the code.  
7.3. Fees are collected programmatically and not by any individual or entity.  
7.4. Front-ends or third-party tools may impose additional fees or gas costs outside the control of SUI Raffler.

## 8. Smart Contract Risk & No Guarantees

14.3. Once a transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, **it cannot be undone**.

## 15. Emergency Pause Function (Mitigation Only)

15.1. Certain SUI Raffler smart contracts **may** include administrative or governance-controlled **pause** capabilities intended **solely** for emergency mitigation (e.g., severe vulnerabilities, exploit risk, illicit activity indicators, or other unforeseen issues).  
15.2. A pause **does not** guarantee loss prevention and **cannot** reverse prior transactions.  
15.3. Pause controls may be time-limited, multi-sig, or otherwise constrained by the deployed code, and may be modified or removed by future governance or upgrades if such mechanisms exist in the code.  
15.4. The existence of a pause function **does not** imply ongoing monitoring, duty of care, or operational control.

## 16. Regulatory Disclosures (MiCA and Similar Regimes)

16.1. SUI Raffler is a decentralized, non-custodial set of open-source smart contracts. It does **not** issue asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens, or other regulated crypto-assets, nor does it custody client funds or provide fiat on/off-ramp services.
